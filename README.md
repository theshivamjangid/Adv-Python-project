# Adv-Python-project

A python project which uses some advance concepts of python to make some insights on Housing dataset

Excel file - Housing dataset

Pyhton file - Project based on the Housing dataset

I have used google colab for making this project. So if you want to see the output of each code please use google colab, since I have used folium library to show the data points on the actual map so I would suggest you to open this file in colab.
